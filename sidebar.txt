## Rules

Take a look at our [FAQ](http://goo.gl/QAxBrF) before posting a question.

###1. No **personal info**
* Sharing personal info isn't allowed per [reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules). Breaking this rule will result in a permanent ban and a report to the admins.

###2. No **server** ads or discussion.
* This means that you can't promote a server address in positive or negative context. Either it be (1)advertising, (2)recruiting for, (3)links to or (4)complaints (admin abuse) of a **specific server**. Any post or comment containing server details will be removed. If you want to advertise your server, please head to /r/playrustservers.

###3. No **memes**, comics and content not directly related to or taken from Rust
* Memes (image macros) and comics or posts not taken from, related to or created for Rust are not allowed. If you want to post such content, please head to /r/playrustlol. Keep in mind that a comic or art specifically made for Rust is allowed. Original content is encouraged!

###4. No **Looking For Group** or similar
* If you're looking to group up with fellow Rust players, or are looking to expand your existing clan, or perhaps looking for more admins for your server, please look and post in /r/playrustlfg.

###5. No posts referencing **exploits**/**cheats**
* Posts and comments referencing exploits or cheats will be removed (posting links to cheats, a guide to exploit, etc). Users that advertise specific cheats will be banned without a prior warning.

###6. No **naming and shaming** of cheaters & no **VAC-ban complaints**
* Posts and comments naming and shaming specific cheaters will be removed. Posting those to /r/playrust won't get the cheaters banned.  
Do you think you've been **incorrectly VAC-banned**? Please contact Steam by sending a support ticket. The subreddit can not help you.

###7. No **livestreams**

* Livestreams are not allowed to avoid self promotion.

###8. No **giveaways**

* Giveaways aren't allowed. /r/playrust isn't an advertising platform.

###9. Mark content **NSFW** accordingly
* We don't want someone to get fired for looking at a virtual penis. Please tag your content NSFW if it's NSFW.

Help us remove offending posts & comments by clicking the relevant report link. Messaging the moderators for a report will be appreciated as well. Make sure to include a link!
